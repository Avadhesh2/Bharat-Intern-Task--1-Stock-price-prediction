#Stock-price-prediction
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Stock Price Prediction" data science project completed during the Data Science internship with "BHARAT INTERN." The main objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the future stock prices of a company based on historical stock market data.

Project Description
Predicting stock prices is a critical challenge in the financial industry. This project focused on analyzing historical stock market data, such as stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant factors, to build a predictive model. The goal was to forecast future stock prices accurately and assist investors and traders in making informed decisions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project, "stock_data.csv," contains the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock data entry.
Open: The opening price of the stock on that date.
High: The highest price of the stock during the trading session.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the trading session.
Close: The closing price of the stock on that date.
Volume: The trading volume (number of shares traded) on that date.
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, which accounts for corporate actions such as stock splits and dividends.
Methodology
The project followed these key steps:

Data Collection: Gathering historical stock price data from reliable sources or APIs.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing any necessary transformations to make it suitable for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Creating additional relevant features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data, visualizing trends and patterns, and gaining insights into the behavior of the stock.

Model Selection: Evaluating various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks, to determine the best model for the prediction task.

Model Training and Evaluation: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the chosen model on the training data, and evaluating its performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics.

Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions for future stock prices.

Visualization: Visualizing the predicted stock prices alongside actual stock prices to assess the model's accuracy.
